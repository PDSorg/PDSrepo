structural connectivity & functional connectivity

> Structural connectivity between pairs of regions was measured in terms of fiber density, defined as the number of streamlines between the two regions, normalized by the average length of the streamlines and average surface area of the two regions

>Here we show that spreading models reveal novel features of brain structure and function. Using an anatomical brain network derived from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), we investigate the anatomical design principles that shape and constrain spreading on brain networks. We consider three scenarios: a single-seed scenario where a perturbation is initiated at a single location, leading to a single cascade, as well as two different two-seed scenarios, where perturbations are initiated at two locations, leading to either cooperative or competitive cascades. We compare our findings to patterns of functional connectivity derived from fMRI, with a focus on resting state networks (RSNs)—the putative building blocks of higher cognitive functions
